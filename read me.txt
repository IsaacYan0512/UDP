--- KEY SETUP---
In order to generate the public and private key pairs held by Alice 
and the H(PK) held by Bob, please run the key_setup.py file first.

Command: python key_setup.py

The program generates the public key file public.pem 

and the private key private.pem in Alic folder 

and the fingerprint file finger_print.txt, 

which is the H(PK) value in Bob folder

---Worning---
!!!Note: The default format for entering a username 
          and password is strictly 
          Bob, 12345bob

Any other input and incorrect formatting 
will cause the program to crash!!!

And as seen above PW is 12345bob


At the same time, 
please do not randomly Alice and Bob folder any files, 
and Alice folder pswd.txt file inside is already saved H (PW) value, 
please do not delete this file or change its path.

---Host---

To run the host program, 

please use the following command line directly

Command: python Host.py

The host will keep waiting for the client to access after running.
Please run the client directly instead of doing any unnecessary input.

---Client---
To run the host program, 

please use the following command line directly

Command: python Client.py

When the host and client programs are successfully run in sequence, 
the client will first ask for a username and password, be sure to enter Bob, 12345bob

After entering the correct username and password, 
the host and client will complete the authentication and key establishment protocol in the background,
and a "Connection OK" message will pop up on the client.



After confirming that the client pops up the message of Connection Okay, 
the host and client can send the message encrypted by RC4 stream cipher to each other at will, 
and the other side will display the decrypted plaintext directly after the successful authentication.
